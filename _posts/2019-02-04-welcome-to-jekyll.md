Hello? Is this thing on?

I'm keeping this default jekyll _posts message here to show that the site responds correctly to blog posts. As I fill up this page with blog posts that I write myself, I will delete this post.

One other thing -- credit to Sujay Kundu for creating and maintaining this open source website template used here: developr-jekyll! It is a fantastic solution for developers looking to display their coding activity and accomplishments in a clean and concise manner. The 'Home' tab contains a link to the developr-jekyll repository -- take a look at the README if the template interests you.

Anyways...

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

or

```javascript
var a = 1;
var b = 2;
function sum (num1,num2){
  return num1+num2;
}
var result = sum(a,b);
```
